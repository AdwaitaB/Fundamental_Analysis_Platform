‬  Many retail investors rely on technical analysis (charts and price movements) for short-term‬
‭ trading but struggle with fundamental analysis, which is key to long-term investing. This‬
‭ app/website simplifies fundamental analysis by allowing users to upload financial documents of‬
‭ a company. The platform then extracts key financial ratios, profitability metrics, and other crucial‬
‭ insights, presenting them in an easy-to-understand format. By automating financial analysis, this‬
‭ tool helps users make well-informed investment decisions based on a company’s true financial‬
‭ health, rather than just market trends.‬
