A brief project write-up
Development Process
The development process was divided into several key phases:

Phase 1: Research and Planning
Identified core features: Company search, document upload, AI recommendations, and visualizations.

Researched APIs and libraries for financial data (e.g., Yahoo Finance) and text processing (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob).

Designed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for seamless interaction.

Phase 2: Core Functionality
Integrated Yahoo Finance API to fetch real-time financial data (e.g., revenue, net income, market cap).

Built a document upload feature using pdfplumber to extract and summarize text from PDFs.

Implemented sentiment analysis using TextBlob to analyze stock news sentiment.

Developed AI-powered recommendations based on financial ratios (e.g., P/E ratio, debt-to-equity) and sentiment scores.

Phase 3: Visualization and User Experience
Created interactive visualizations using Plotly to display financial trends (e.g., revenue growth, debt vs. equity).

Added a heatmap to visualize metric deviations over time.

Designed a professional and modern UI with custom CSS for a polished look.

Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
Tested the tool with sample data and real-world financial documents.

Refined the AI recommendation logic to improve accuracy.

Optimized the tool for performance and scalability.
